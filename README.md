Heads up: I have not worked on this in a long time. It may still be of some use to you if you're trying to get some basic ideas on how to configure and organize your code but I wouldn't use this for much more.

To get things going:
- Install Mongo
- npm install
- npm run test
If it fails, do it twice just to be sure.
- npm run test
If it's fine:
- npm run dev

Then visit localhost:3000 in your favorite browser!
